## Thierry Tran's Computer Science ePortfolio

Welcome to my CS499 ePortfolio, a showcase of my journey in computer science and the work I’ve completed in this capstone course. This portfolio highlights the skills I’ve honed through key enhancements to the Event Tracking Application, focusing on software design, algorithms, and database management. Each enhancement reflects my growth—from improving usability and security to optimizing performance and ensuring data integrity. This ePortfolio not only demonstrates my technical abilities but also my passion for creating efficient, secure, and user-friendly solutions as I prepare to enter the professional world.
