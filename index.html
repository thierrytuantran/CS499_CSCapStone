        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

</p>My journey in computer science has been transformative, marked by growth, resilience, and a passion for problem-solving. Coming from a military background, I transitioned into the field of computer science with the goal of applying my discipline and strategic thinking to the ever-evolving world of technology. Over the course of this program, I have not only developed technical skills but also gained a deep appreciation for the complexities of software design, database management, and algorithm development.

Throughout my studies, I’ve tackled diverse challenges that have honed my skills and prepared me for a career in software development. Courses like **Software Development Lifecycle** and **Client-Server Development** taught me to approach projects systematically, while hands-on projects like the **Event Tracking App** allowed me to bridge theory and practice. Enhancing this application through various lenses—software design, algorithms, and database optimization—showcased my ability to design robust, scalable solutions that meet user needs.

One of my proudest accomplishments has been implementing secure coding practices and input validation in the **Event Tracking App**, reflecting my commitment to creating applications that prioritize user safety and data integrity. Additionally, I’ve embraced emerging trends such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, which I believe are vital to staying relevant in today’s tech landscape.

As I near the completion of my degree, I am more confident than ever in my ability to contribute to the field. I aim to specialize in software engineering, with a focus on building secure and efficient applications. Beyond this program, I plan to further enhance my expertise by pursuing certifications like **CompTIA Security+** and exploring a master’s degree in computer science. These aspirations reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my desire to make a meaningful impact in the industry.

This ePortfolio is a culmination of my academic journey, showcasing my technical abilities, critical thinking skills, and growth as a developer. It demonstrates my readiness to step into the professional world and contribute to innovative solutions. As I look ahead, I am excited to embrace new challenges, apply my knowledge to real-world problems, and grow into a well-rounded software development professional.</p>
