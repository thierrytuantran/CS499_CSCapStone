        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Thierry Tran, a Computer Science student with a strong passion for software development and technology. This ePortfolio showcases my journey and the skills Iâ€™ve honed throughout my studies. My main project for this ePortfolio is the Event Tracking App, which serves as a testament to my growth in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management. This app demonstrates my ability to design and develop a user-centric solution while ensuring robust data handling and efficient algorithms. Through enhancing this app, I showcase the breadth of my expertise in building maintainable, scalable, and secure applications.</p>
