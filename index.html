<p>My journey in computer science has been transformative, marked by growth, resilience, and a passion for problem-solving. Coming from a military background, I transitioned into the field of computer science with the goal of applying my discipline and strategic thinking to the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

<p>Over the course of this program, I have not only developed technical skills but also gained a deep appreciation for the complexities of software design, database management, and algorithm development. Throughout my studies, I’ve tackled diverse challenges that have honed my skills and prepared me for a career in software development. Courses like <strong>Software Development Lifecycle</strong> and <strong>Client-Server Development</strong> taught me to approach projects systematically, while hands-on projects like the <strong>Event Tracking App</strong> allowed me to bridge theory and practice. Enhancing this application through various lenses—software design, algorithms, and database optimization—showcased my ability to design robust, scalable solutions that meet user needs.</p>

<p>One of my proudest accomplishments has been implementing secure coding practices and input validation in the <strong>Event Tracking App</strong>, reflecting my commitment to creating applications that prioritize user safety and data integrity. Additionally, I’ve embraced emerging trends such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, which I believe are vital to staying relevant in today’s tech landscape.</p>

<p>As I near the completion of my degree, I am more confident than ever in my ability to contribute to the field. I aim to specialize in software engineering, with a focus on building secure and efficient applications. Beyond this program, I plan to further enhance my expertise by pursuing certifications like <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> and exploring a master’s degree in computer science. These aspirations reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my desire to make a meaningful impact in the industry.</p>

<p>This ePortfolio is a culmination of my academic journey, showcasing my technical abilities, critical thinking skills, and growth as a developer. It demonstrates my readiness to step into the professional world and contribute to innovative solutions. As I look ahead, I am excited to embrace new challenges, apply my knowledge to real-world problems, and grow into a well-rounded software development professional.</p>

    <section id="software-design">
        <h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
        <p>This enhancement focused on improving the Event Tracking Application by restructuring the code to follow modular design principles and implementing robust input validation mechanisms. Key updates included creating a UserController class to separate business logic from the UI, enhancing the SignUpActivity to validate usernames and passwords with stricter criteria, and improving code readability with better documentation and comments. These changes showcase my ability to design maintainable, secure, and user-friendly applications.</p>

    <section id="algorithms">
        <h2>Algorithms and Data Structure</h2>
        <p>For this enhancement, I optimized the sorting and data-handling functionalities within the Event Tracking Application. I implemented a sorting algorithm to display events in alphabetical order, ensuring responsive interactions even as the dataset grows. The application now sorts events immediately after a new one is added or updated, improving user experience and functionality. This enhancement highlights my skills in applying algorithmic principles to solve real-world challenges.</p>

        <h2>Databases</h2>
        <p>The final enhancement centered on improving the database layer of the Event Tracking Application. I implemented input sanitization techniques to protect the application from potential malicious inputs, such as SQL injection, and added checks to prevent duplicate event entries for users. I also refactored the database methods to make them more streamlined and maintainable, incorporating try-finally blocks for proper resource management. These updates ensured the app's database operations were both secure and efficient. Through this process, I developed a stronger appreciation for how critical robust database management is to the overall reliability of an application.</p>
